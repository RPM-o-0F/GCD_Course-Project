The repository includes:
  run_analysis.R: R code to meet the requirements of the project
  codebook.md:    Markdown file that provides an explanation of variables and data elements created and used in run_analysis.R
  
From the definition:
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
